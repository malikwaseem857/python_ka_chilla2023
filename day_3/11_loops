# 2 kind of loops
# While loop and For loops

# x=0
# while (x<5):  # while is a function
#     print(x)
#     x=x+1 #if you don't increment the value, it will be stuck in an infinite loop

# x=0
# while (x<=5):  # while is a function
#     print(x)
#     x=x+1
# For loops
# for x in range(5):  # range is a function
#     print(x)  # it will print 0,1,2,3,4
# 
#
for x in range(4-11):  # range is a function
#     print(x)  # it will print 4,6,7,8,9,10
#
#
#
#
# array
# days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

# for d in days:
#     print(d)  # it will print each day in the array

# days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

# for d in days:
#     if (d=="Friday"): break # break will stop the loop
#     print(d)  # it will print each day in the array


# days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

# for d in days:
#     # if (d=="Friday"): # break will stop the loop
#     if (d=="Friday"): continue # continue will skip the current iteration like "friday"
#     print(d)


# loops done
