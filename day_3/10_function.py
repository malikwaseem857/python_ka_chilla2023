# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")

# functions are defined by yourself
# 1. definig a function
# def print_Codanics():
#     print("We are learning with Ammar")
#     print("We are learning with Ammar")
#     print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print_Codanics()

# # 2. definig a function with arguments or text
# def print_Codanics():
#     text = "We are learning with Ammar"
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)

# print_Codanics()
# 3. 
# def print_Codanics(text):
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)

# print_Codanics("We are learning with Ammar in Codanics youtube Channel")

# 4. defining a function with if, elif and else statements

# def school_calculator(age, text):
#     if age==5:
#         print("Hammad can join the school")
#     elif age>5:
#         print("Hammad should go to higher school")
#     else:
#         print("Hammad is still cool baby")
    
# # school_calculator(5, "Hammad")
# # school_calculator(15, "Hammad")
# school_calculator(2, "Hammad")


# school_calculator(2) by mathematical operation


# defining a function of future

# def future_age(age):
#     new_age=age+20
#     return new_age
#     print(new_age) 

# future_predicted_age= future_age(18)
# print(future_predicted_age)
