# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print("We are learning with Ammar")

# functions are defined by yourself
# 1. defining a function
# def print_Codanics(): # def is defing and codanics(): is a function
#     print("We are learning with Ammar")
#     print("We are learning with Ammar")
#     print("We are learning with Ammar")
# print_Codanics()

# # 2. defining a function with arguments or text
# def print_Codanics():
#     text = "We are learning with Ammar"
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text) # output: it will give us 3 times 
# print_Codanics()
# 3. 
# def print_Codanics(text):
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#print_Codanics("We are learning with Ammar in Codanics youtube Channel")

# 4. defining a function with if, elif and else statements

# def school_calculator(age, text):
#     if age==5:
#         print("Hammad can join the school")
#     elif age>5:
#         print("Hammad should go to higher school")
#     else:
#         print("Hammad is still cool baby")
# # school_calculator(5, "Hammad") # output: Hammad can join the school
# # school_calculator(15, "Hammad") # output: Hammad should go to higher school
# school_calculator(2, "Hammad")    # output: Hammad is still cool baby


# Small Machine Learning Model
# defining a function of future
# def future_age(age):
#     new_age=age+20
#     return new_age
#     print(new_age) 

# future_predicted_age= future_age(18)
# print(future_predicted_age)
