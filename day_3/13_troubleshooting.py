# how to troubleshoot the error 
# print("We are learning with Python with Dr. Ammar") # syntax error means the code is not correct, so we need to fix it by adding ""

# print(25/0)

# name= "Waseem"
# print("Hello name") # this is symntax error because we are missing a variable name in the print function

name= "Waseem"
print("Hello", name) # this is correct syntax, we are using a variable name in the print function
# if we add plus sign between the strings, it will be treated as a string concatenation

# troubleshooting is easy
